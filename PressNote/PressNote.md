This one week training suitable for all professionals commenced from December 02, 2020 
onwards with an inaugural session. Course Co-ordinator, Dr H S Rai welcoming all the
participants outlined the essence of the training program. He said that the functioning 
of any individual or an organisation is dependent on its documentation. He added that
even a small document, like an office memo or a notice undergoes a number of revisions
and every task involves multiple persons. Most of us, most of the time maintain various 
revisions by giving appropriate names, and sending latest edition / version to other 
involved (through pen-drive or e-mails)for incorporating in their work or for review.
This is definitely an inefficient approach resulting in poor workflow. 
Dr Rai added that this workshop will emphasize on Version Control System (VCS) 
which will address the highlighted issues and will result in efficient, trackable and sustainable workflow.
