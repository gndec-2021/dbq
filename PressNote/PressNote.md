This one week training
suitable for all professionals commenced from December 02, 2020 onwards with an inaugural session.
Course Co-ordinator, Dr H S Rai welcoming all the participants outlined the essence of the
training program. He said that the functioning of any individual or an organisation is
dependent on its documentation. He added that even a small document, like an office memo
or a notice undergoes a number of revisions and every task involves multiple persons. 
Most of us, most of the time maintain various revisions by giving appropriate names,
and sending latest edition / version to other involved (through pen-drive or e-mails)
for incorporating in their work or for review. This is definitely an inefficient 
approach resulting in poor workflow. Dr Rai added that this workshop will emphasize 
on Version Control System (VCS) which will address the highlighted issues and will result
in efficient, trackable and sustainable workflow.

and the entire training team.
