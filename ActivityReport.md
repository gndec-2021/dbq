### Name of Event - SKill Development Training on "Efficient, Trackable and Sustainable Workflow" 
### Date and Venue of Event - December 02 to December 08, 2020 (Online Mode)


### Course Content

To address the issues associated with poor workflow, and making sure that the computer resources are used
efficiently and with the provision to track changes, TEQIP-III sponsored skill development training on
"Efficient, Trackable and Sustainable Workflow" was organised by Examination Branch of 
Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) in association with Departments of Civil Engineering 
and Computer Science Engineering. 

As intended, this Skill development training imparted the participants all the necessary tools,
hands-on practical sessions to solve all the issues related to documentation and its version control,
and made sure that computer resources are used efficiently (thus making the process green) and with the provision to track 
who proposed the changes or who drafted what and who approved that, later any time, and roll-back, if there is necessity of that.

This one week training which was suitable for all professionals commenced from December 02, 2020 onwards on a self-paced mode. 
The skill development training concluded successfully with a valedictory function. There was a diverse range of participants in 
the course from the Principal of the institution, faculty members, students to non-teaching staff.
In order to deliver the course content effectively and efficiently, an excellent learning platform and content management system called Moodle was used. 
This platform enabled the partcipants to learn and attain hands on experience at their own pace. The training program also encouraged peer learning 
by discussing doubts among participants at the dedicated forum. Furthermore, keeping in view the changing scenario, the training program
emphasized on paper-less and thus a sustainable approach towards documentation by using available open-source powerful tools. 

For 


TEQIP Coordintor Dr Harwinder Singh, expressed his contentment on successful execution and completion of the training program.

Guest of honour and founder of Sabudh Foundation, Dr Sarabjot Singh Anand expressed his heartiest congratulation to the institute for conducting such a wonderful and much needed course. Guest of honour and Director UIET, Panjab University, Dr Savita Gupta expressed her honour to be a part of this program which is the need of the hour. She emphasized that such a version control system for sustainable workflow is vital for effective work culture in every organisation. She congratulated organisers for the remarkable effort in this direction.

Dr Sehijpal Singh, Principal, GNDEC, while addressing the audience said that efficient workflow is the need of every organisation as poor documentation often leads to mismanagement and wastage of lot of resources. He expressed his views on importance of this much needed course for addressing the said issues. Furthermore, he, as a course participant too, said that the training program was an enjoyble and a great learning experience. He congratulated the organising team for this wonderful effort and dedicated approach during the training program.

In the end, Course Co-Coordinator Prof Yuvraj Singh thanked all the participants and dignitaries for making this program a great success.

### Expected Benefits Derived and How it will be helpful to the College

**The participants after attending the training should be able to** 

- Manage version control of every document easily, making it easy to explore the changes that occurred to it at different points of time.
- Keep all files necessary for a particular project in a central place (repository), and give access to authorised persons, with tracking ability. 
To that central repository team members can add documents, images, links, graphs, etc.
- Review other peopleâ€™s documents, add comments to certain lines or the overall document, and suggest changes.
- Maintain online backup of data. Everyone who has rights can access the data.

During the valedictory function, feedback from participants and course reviewers was taken. The participants expressed their joy in learning new skills
during the training program. One of the participants said that, if implemented, such a version control system can prove to be a revolutionary
step for the organisation to address issues related to effective management of documentation.

As far as our institute is concerned, already a shift and a positive inclination towards this version control system can be seen in the college. 
As a result of which we are also expecting release of latest College Newsletter through the use of GitHub.
Organising team is excited to see how it goes and would happily extend help in every possible way to bring this revolutionary change.
